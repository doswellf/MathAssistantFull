Polarization Description of Drifting Charge Carriers in Nondegenerate Plasmas

Rather than study single particles in a plasma, use a "liquid particle" as a specific particle of a continuous material.
This liquid particle represents a physically infinitesimal  volume containing a group of charges.

The volume considered needs to be small enough relative to the macroscopic dimensions of the system under study to allow for ensemble averaging. The dynamic macroscopic properties of this liquid particle quantities typical of this liquid particle.

The liquid particle volume must contain a statistically large number of real particles.

For plasmas the dimensions of each liquid particle cannot be smaller than the Debye length
This size exceeds the microscopic dimensions of interatomic distance for solid lattices, free paths for mobile carriers, etc.

Dynamic (macroscopic) characteristics results from motion of individual chart carriers inside the liquid particle. 
Dynamic characteristics are:

mean electron density                       n
charge density                                  ρ=e*n
hydrodynamic electron velocity          v
current density                                 J = ρ*v
electron temperature                        T
electron pressure                            p = n*k_b*T

Microscopic electron scattering processes are described by:
momentum relaxation time            τ
mean free path time
energy relaxation time τ_ε
electron-electron collision frequency ν_ee

Electron temperature is a thermodynamically defined value only when ν_ee >> 1/τ_e
When ν_ee >> τ_e frequent electron-electron collisions  create an energy distribution within the electron cloud.
The distribution is described by a symmetrical component of the energy distribution of the electrons.
This symmetrical component takes the form of a Maxwellian distribution with temperature T different from the lattice 
temperature T_0 in the presence of strong electric fields.

Under conditions of local thermal equillibrium in the electron cloud, there is a balance of power flow to and from the electrons. The electric field E supplies power to the electrons while the losses occur due to medium properties and other
sinks.

The energy relaxation time τ_e(T) is a function of electron temperature
The energy relaxation time determines the rate of chaanges in T
The momentum relaxation time  τ(T) expresses the temperature dependence of the electron mobility
μ(T)=(e/m)*τ(T)

In the presence of magnetic induction (flux) B the current density is:

where the conductivity of the medium is σ(T)=e*n*μ(T)

Eqn (D.1) holds only when electron temperature T(r_vec,t) can follow changes in E(r_vec,t) and electron denisty n(r_vec,t).
The ability to follow these changes over time results in local thermal equillibrium.
The conditions for this equillibrium are given by τ_e << T_M where T_M = ε/σ
T_M=ε/σ is the Maxwellian relaxation time that determines the time scale of changes in E and the charge distribution.

Solution of (D.2) results in this expression for current density:

The influence of magnetic field with arbitrary magnitude and orientation on the elecctron gas heating is 
taken into account by the effective heating field (D.5) using b = μ*B
Find the functional dependence T(E_h) using (D.4) with specific temperature functions for the relaxation times
τ_e(T) and τ(T).

This allows the temperature dependencies to be represented as field dependencies τ(E_h) and τ_e(E_h)
 
Classical hydrodynamics provdes two approaches to describe the dynamics of liquid motion. They are the Lagrangian (L) and the Eulerian (E) descriptions. The polarization (P) description originated in the vacuum tube era. The P description was extended to deal with nondegenerate gaseous and semiconductor plasmas.

The L, E, and P equations for charged media are differentiated by: 
    The choice of liquid particle position
    Representation of liquid particle motion 

For the analysis of linear small signal systems consider two states of the carrier stream:
    unperturbed
    perturbed
