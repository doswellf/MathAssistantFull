EM Analysis Using FDTD

Lecture 23 - 3D FDTD

Assumptions
    Material Dimensions are inifinite in the X and Y directions
    Material Dimensions are finite in the Z direction

PML only on Z axis boundaries
Periodic Boundary Conditions  on X and Y axis boundaries

Cross Gratings ‚ü∂ Infinitely Periodic in X and Y directions

Introduce Plane Wave Source using Total Field/Scattered Field

PML 'box' placed around grid wheen PML is used on all sides

Erase PML on X and Y Axes

Simplify and Streamline Update Equations!

PML Integration Terms for X and Y are eliminated, simplifying PML update equations
